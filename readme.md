# Youtube Playlist Titles
## An implementation of the Youtube Data API
This script is mostly for my personnal use, hence a raw interface and no explanation at all. It uses the Youtube API to fetch data from my musical playlists. The use cases are pretty limited except when some videos are deleted due to copiright infrigment. I can then keep a trace of the tracks that were deleted.

If you want to use it, you'll need a google account and go through the process described [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python)
